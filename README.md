# machine-learning

This repo contains various machine learning algorithms implemented in python on top of TensorFlow.

Here is the list of implemented algorithms:
 * [Neural Network](src/neural.net) - A simple customizable multilayered neural networkimplementation.

## Quickstart

1. [Install Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html)
2. Run algorithm (e.g. `python src/neural.net`)
